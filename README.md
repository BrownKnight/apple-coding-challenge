# In-memory store coding challenge

The majority of my solution to the challenge can be found
in [src/com/applecodingchallenge/InMemoryStore.java](src/com/applecodingchallenge/InMemoryStore.java).

To validate the correctness of the solution against the success criteria, I've written a few tests in
the [test/com/applecodingchallenge/InMemoryStoreTest.java](test/com/applecodingchallenge/InMemoryStoreTest.java) file.

The only external package used for this solution is JUnit 5, for the unit tests.
